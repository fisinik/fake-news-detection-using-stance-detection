# Fake News Detection Using Stance Detection

## About

- <strong>University: </strong>University of Prishtina
- <strong>Faculty: </strong>Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering
- <strong>Study Program: </strong>Master of Computer and Software Engineering
- <strong>Subject (2nd year): </strong>Natural Language Processing taught by [Dr. Sc. MÃ«rgim Hoti](https://staff.uni-pr.edu/profile/m%C3%ABrgimhoti)
- <strong>Students:</strong> [Festina Qorrolli](https://github.com/festinaqorrolli) and [Fisnik Spahija](https://github.com/Fisinik/)

The goal of this [project](https://github.com/fisinik/fake-news-detection-using-stance-detection) is to develop a system that uses stance detection to identify fake news. The model analyzes the relationship between claims made in an article and other sources of verified information to assess the truthfulness of the content.. This project is used for the Natural Language Processing course in University of Prishtina, Computer and Software Engineering.

## Instructions

This project requires venv environment. This can be done by creating a workspace environment through VScode. Make sure python and pip are installed.

Install kernel for the environment by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install ipykernel
```

Install the necessary packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets overview

### Attributes of FNC-1 (4):

- "Headline" <strong>(categorical nominal)</strong>
- "ArticleBody" <strong>(categorical nominal)</strong>
- "Body ID" <strong>(categorical nominal)</strong>
- "Stance" <strong>(categorical nominal)</strong>

### Attributes of FARN (5):

- "Title" <strong>(categorical nominal)</strong>
- "Text" <strong>(categorical nominal)</strong>
- "Subject" <strong>(categorical nominal)</strong>
- "Date" <strong>(categorical nominal)</strong>
- "Stance" <strong>(categorical nominal)</strong>

### Data integration

Our datasets are separated as following:

#### FNC-1

train_bodies.csv and train_stances.csv files. These are combined by the "Body ID" to a single dataframe containing all the attributes needed to move forward.

#### FARN

fake_news.csv and real_news.csv files are separated on the stance basis. We combine both datasets into a dataframe and add a stance for both files "FAKE" and "REAL".

### Dataset Size

#### FNC-1

The distribution of `Stance` classes in `train_stances.csv` is as follows:

|  rows | unrelated | discuss |     agree |  disagree |
| ----: | --------: | ------: | --------: | --------: |
| 49972 |   0.73131 | 0.17828 | 0.0736012 | 0.0168094 |

#### FARN

The distribution of `Stance` classes in `fake_news.csv` and `real_news.csv` is as follows:

|  rows |   fake |   real |
| ----: | -----: | -----: |
| 44919 | 0.5232 | 0.4768 |
