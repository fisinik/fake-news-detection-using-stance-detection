## About

- <strong>University: </strong>University of Prishtina
- <strong>Faculty: </strong>Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering
- <strong>Study Program: </strong>Master of Computer and Software Engineering
- <strong>Subject (2nd year): </strong>Natural Language Processing taught by [Dr. Sc. MÃ«rgim Hoti](https://staff.uni-pr.edu/profile/m%C3%ABrgimhoti)

The goal of this [project](https://github.com/fisinik/fake-news-detection-using-stance-detection) is to develop a system that uses stance detection to identify fake news. The model analyzes the relationship between claims made in an article and other sources of verified information to assess the truthfulness of the content.. This project is used for the Natural Language Processing course in University of Prishtina, Computer and Software Engineering.
